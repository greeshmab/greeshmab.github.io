I am a PhD student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in Applied Mathematics & Statistics focusing in Finance. I achieved my undergraduate degree from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) in Mathematics and Computing and Post Graduate Diploma in Governance from the University of Hyderabad. I am interested in solving research problems in Applied Mathematics mostly centering on Finance and Technology.

In my free time, I love to play Basketball or binge-watch shows. I recently started pursuing my interest in painting and photography.

My research interests are focused on Mathematical Quant models, Machine learning/AI tools and their applications in finance.
