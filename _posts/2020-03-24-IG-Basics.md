Riemannian Geometry is a branch of differential geometry that studies Riemannian Manifolds,smooth manifolds with a Reimannian metric i.e inner product on the tangent space at each point that varies smoothly from point to point.

A Riemannian metric g on a smooth manifold M is a smoothly chosen inner product $g_x$ : T*M × T*M → R on each of the tangent spaces T*M of M. In other words, for each x ∈ M, g = $g_x$ satisfies

(1). g(u,v) = g(v,u) for all $u,v ∈ T*M

(2). g(u,u) ≥ 0 for all u ∈ T*M

(3). g(u,u) = 0 if and only if u = 0

Furthermore, g is smooth in the sense that for any smooth vector fields X and Y , the function $x → g_x(X_x, Y_x)$ is smooth.
